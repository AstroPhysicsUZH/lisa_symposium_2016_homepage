<h1>Common Questions</h1>

<p>
    Welcome to the LISA Symposium XI. We are very happy to welcome more than 250 participants and are looking forward to an interesting and engaging conference. This sheet will give you some important information about the course of events.

<h2>Public transportation</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        You were sent a personal ticket for public transportation in Zurich. Please do always carry it with you, either printed out or on a mobile device, as well as some form of personal identification. Using public transportation without having the ticket and identification on you will result in a fine (CHF 100.-).
    </li>
    <li>
        Your ticket is valid within the city limits of Zurich (Zone 110) from Monday to Friday. It is also valid for traveling to the conference dinner on Wednesday evening. However, it is NOT valid for the way to the airport, you will need to buy a separate ticket for that.
