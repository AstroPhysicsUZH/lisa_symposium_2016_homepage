<h2>Travelling in / around Zurich</h2>

<p>
  We highly recommend using public transports.
</p>

<h3>Public Transports</h3>
<p>
  Zurich has a <a href="http://www.zvv.ch/zvv/en/home.html">unified public transport system (ZVV)</a>: one ticket is valid for all means of transportation like trains, busses, trams, trolleys and ships.
  Please make sure to get a ticket <b>before</b> entering the vehicle.
  Tickets can be bought at every stops (using Swiss Francs or Debit Card).
  Connections usually run every 7 to 15 minutes.
  <br>
  There are 3 kind of tickets:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Short range (CHF 2.60) "Nahstrecke"</b><br>
    Valid for travelling only a few stops in one direction, for half an hour.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Single Ticket (CHF 4.30) "Einzelbillet"</b><br>
    Valid for travelling in the city for one hour.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Day Pass (CHF 8.60) "Tageskarte"</b><br>
    Valid for travelling in the city for one day (24 hours).
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Each of those can be bought as a single ticket, or as a multiple-journey ticket ("Mehrfahrten Karte") with 6 journeys and 10% discount.
  The multiple-journey ticket has to be validated <b>each time before</b> entering the vehicle at the vending machine.
</p>

<p>
  If you stay 5 days and / or close by the Irchel campus, we recommend getting single "day pass tickets" on demand.
  If you stay 6 days and have to take the tram daily to get to Irchel and/or want to travel around in Zurich often, we recommend getting the multiple-journey card with day passes.
</p>


<h3>Taxis</h3>
<p>
  Taxis are quite expensive. Expect to pay from CHF 20.- upwards even for short rides.
  <br>
  Phone Numbers:
  <a href="tel:+41444444444">+41 44 444 44 44</a> or
  <a href="tel:+41447777777">+41 44 777 77 77</a>.
</p>


<h3>Car</h3>
<p>
  We don't recommend arriving by car in Zurich.
  There is a carpark at Irchel. Expect to pay CHF (parking time in hours)+1.
  Finding parking spots in the city is only for the brave.
