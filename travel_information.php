<h2>Paying in Zurich</h2>
<p>
  Please be aware, that Switzerland has it's own currency, the Swiss Franc (CHF), and not adapted the Euro.
  There are some places where you can pay with Euros, and get the change back in Swiss Francs, but at a very unfavourable rate.
  We adivse to get money from ATM's or change in a bank. ATMs are available everywhere, there is one on the campus.

  In the university (cafeteria) you can only pay with Swiss Francs in <b>cash</b>.
  No credit / debit cards can be accepted.

<h2>Travelling in / around Zurich</h2>
<p>
  We highly recommend using public transports.
</p>
<h3>Public Transports</h3>
<p>
  Zurich has a <a href="http://www.zvv.ch/zvv/en/home.html">unified public transport system (ZVV)</a>: one ticket is valid for all means of transportation like trains, busses, trams, trolleys and ships.
  Please make sure to get a ticket <b>before</b> entering the vehicle.
  Tickets can be bought at every stops (using Swiss Francs or Debit Card).
  Connections usually run every 7 to 15 minutes.
  <br>
  There are 3 kind of tickets:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Short range (CHF 2.60) "Nahstrecke"</b><br>
    Valid for travelling only a few stops in one direction, for half an hour.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Single Ticket (CHF 4.30) "Einzelbillet"</b><br>
    Valid for travelling in the city for one hour.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Day Pass (CHF 8.60) "Tageskarte"</b><br>

</ul>
<p>
  Each of those can be bought as a single ticket, or as a multiple-journey ticket ("Mehrfahrten Karte") with 6 journeys and 10% discount.
  The multiple-journey ticket has to be validated <b>each time before</b> entering the vehicle at the vending machine.

  If you stay 5 days and / or close by the Irchel campus, we recommend getting single "day pass tickets" on demand.
  If you stay 6 days and have to take the tram daily to get to Irchel and/or want to travel around in Zurich often, we recommend getting the multiple-journey card with day passes.
